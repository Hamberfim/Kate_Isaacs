QUICK (2-week) turnaround simple website design, text, and a few graphicsQUICK (2-week) turnaround simple website design, text, and a few graphics


I need to redesign my website kateisaacs.com, which is hosted on wix.com. I have wire frames and most of my text, and I have basic proficiency editing text so I can add/edit once the new design is complete. The website is static (for now) with no moving parts except a contact page. The ideal person would be able to design a few graphics or partner with someone who could. I need mobile optimization. I will pay hourly but would like a quote for a whole job estimate.
